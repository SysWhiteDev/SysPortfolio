# EyeHide: Simplified Privacy for Everyone ðŸ˜Š

#### Why We Created EyeHide
At EyeHide, we are deeply concerned about the growing trend of neglecting user privacy, especially with the rise of AI and large language models. We believe everyone deserves a secure digital experience without compromising their privacy.

#### How We Mitigate the Issue
To address this, we've developed a custom operating system bundled with our laptops. Our solution is designed for users of all skill levels, providing a ready-to-use system for everything from professional work to web browsing, all with enhanced privacy features.
