# TrashTracer

#### Project Evolution and Achievements

This project has undergone significant development and transformation over its two-year lifespan. It all began at the NOI Hackathon 2022. Our initial goal was to utilize large format displays to show a leaderboard for individuals who recycled the most. This innovative idea aimed to encourage and promote recycling by visually highlighting the top recyclers, making the process both engaging and competitive. The project received positive feedback and sparked interest in further development.

‎

In 2023, we decided to revisit and expand upon the project for the Progetto Rocca, a local competition that focuses on creating environmentally friendly websites. We saw this as an excellent opportunity to align our project with green initiatives and further its impact. To meet the requirements of the competition and improve the project's functionality, we overhauled the entire codebase. This involved not only refining the existing features but also developing a new app to integrate with the project. The app aimed to enhance user experience and accessibility, making it easier for individuals to track and participate in recycling activities. Our efforts were rewarded with the project's second award, recognizing our commitment to environmental sustainability and innovative design.

‎

The project's journey did not stop there. Later in the year, we participated in a school event where our accomplishments were acknowledged once again. The event organizers recognized the two major milestones we had achieved: the initial success at the NOI Hackathon and the subsequent recognition at the Progetto Rocca. This acknowledgment came in the form of a third award, celebrating our continuous improvement and dedication to promoting recycling and green initiatives. This recognition at the school event not only validated our hard work but also motivated us to continue pushing the boundaries of what this project can achieve.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the work I've done.
