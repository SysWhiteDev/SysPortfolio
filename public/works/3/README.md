# AEFFC

This application is inspired by Reddit's r/place, and we've put our own unique spin on it to bring you an engaging and collaborative pixel art experience. Unlike r/place, our version operates without timeouts, allowing for continuous creativity and collaboration. The application is built using Vue.js for the frontend and utilizes Redis for efficient caching.

#### The journey
This project was developed for the First Lego League 2024 Creative branch, aiming to provide a platform where users can collectively create pixel art. Inspired by the popular Reddit experiment r/place, our application removes the restriction of timeouts, enabling users to place pixels freely and continuously.

#### Usage
Once the website is open, users can start placing pixels on the canvas. The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to select colors and place pixels with ease. The canvas updates in real-time, reflecting the contributions of all users instantaneously.

#### Award
We won the regional award and got promoted to nationals, unfortunately we didn't receive any updates on the status of our application.
